Guess the colour game: The game is about testing playersâ€™ knowledge of
RGB colour codes. RGB code of an unknown colour will be given for e.g-
RGB(255, 0, 0). Guess the right colour out of random colours by clicking on
them. It also has 2 levels Easy/Hard based on the number of colour blocks
shown.
